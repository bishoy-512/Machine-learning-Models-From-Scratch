# Machine Learning Models from Scratch 🚀

This repository contains **pure Python implementations** of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms, built completely from scratch (without scikit-learn or similar libraries).  
The main goal is to understand the **mathematical foundations** and **logic** behind each algorithm.  

## 📌 Implemented Models
- 🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- 🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- 🔹 Linear Regression  
- 🔹 Logistic Regression  

## 📖 Features
- ✨ Pure Python & NumPy-based implementations  
- ✨ Beginner-friendly, step-by-step code  
- ✨ Focus on concepts, not just using libraries  
- ✨ Easy to extend for other models  

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-models-from-scratch.git
cd ml-models-from-scratch
